"""
Graph search to find shortest path between two cities.

A road map is represented as a directed graph.
Edges represent road segments and are labeled with distances.
Nodes represent cities.
We use depth first search to find the shortest distance
between two cities. During the depth-first search from
start to end, we compute a 'shortest known distance to here from start'
attribute for each node.  After completion of depth first search,
destination city should be labeled with the shortest distance from
the start city.
